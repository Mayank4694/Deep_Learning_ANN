# Diabetes_Prediction_with_ANN

#### Problem:
Predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures

#### Data Source:
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

#### Content
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

#### Techniques used
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Imabalanced Machine Learning
3. ANN architecture design and Keras Tuner
4. Setting a random seed for reproducibility
5. Using the ModelCheckpoint callback to save the best model based on validation accuracy
